# Blockchain Implementation

This is a basic implementation of a blockchain using the Go programming language. The code defines the structures and functions necessary to create a blockchain, add blocks to it, and validate the blocks.

## Prerequisites

-   Go programming language (version 1.16 or later)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository or download the source code files.
    
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
    
3.  Build and run the application using the following command:
    
    shellCopy code
    
    `go run main.go` 
    

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are as follows:

-   `SmartContract` struct: Represents a smart contract with its code.
    
-   `Transaction` struct: Represents a transaction with sender, receiver, and amount.
    
-   `Block` struct: Represents a block in the blockchain with index, data (transactions), contracts (smart contracts), hash, previous hash, timestamp, and nonce.
    
-   `Blockchain` struct: Represents the blockchain with a slice of blocks and difficulty level.
    
-   `NewBlockchain()` function: Creates a new blockchain with a genesis block.
    
-   `NewGenesisBlock()` function: Creates a new genesis block (the first block in the blockchain).
    
-   `NewBlock()` function: Creates a new block with the provided data, contracts, and previous hash.
    
-   `MineBlock()` method: Mines the block by repeatedly calculating the hash and checking its validity based on the difficulty level.
    
-   `CalculateHash()` method: Calculates the hash of the block.
    
-   `IsValid()` method: Checks if the block's hash meets the difficulty requirement.
    
-   `AddBlock()` method: Adds a new block to the blockchain.
    
-   `GetLatestBlock()` method: Retrieves the latest block in the blockchain.
    
-   `Print()` method: Prints the entire blockchain.
    
-   `Validator` struct: Represents a block validator with a reference to the blockchain.
    
-   `NewValidator()` function: Creates a new block validator with the given blockchain.
    
-   `Validate()` method: Validates a block by checking its hash, previous hash, data, and nonce.
    
-   `TestCreateBlockchain()` function: Tests the creation of a new blockchain.
    
-   `TestAddBlock()` function: Tests the addition of a new block to the blockchain.
    
-   `TestMineBlock()` function: Tests the mining of a block.
    
-   `TestValidateBlock()` function: Tests the validation of a block.
    
-   `TestMain()` function: Runs all the tests.
    
-   `PrintJSON()` method: Prints the blockchain in JSON format.
    

## Usage

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the blockchain implementation. It creates a new blockchain, adds transactions and smart contracts to a new block, mines the block, adds it to the blockchain, and performs block validation. The blockchain and the validation result are then printed.
